			(NICAR), Krystal and I wandered into a local restaurant to try the crab cake and oysters.
			“Texas might have oysters from the Gulf of Mexico,” she said, “but East Coast oysters are
			meaty, sweet, and unlike anything you’ve ever tasted. Try them, and I promise you’ll never
			look at oysters the same way again.”</p> <p>People often associate oysters with the city’s upscale raw bars or elaborate seafood towers,
			but oysters were once abundant throughout the Chesapeake Bay. In the 1880s, the Bay supplied
			nearly half of the world’s annual oyster demand, with scholars comparing the harvesting frenzy
			to the California Gold Rush.</p> <p>Unfortunately, like the Gold Rush, this wealth was also fleeting. By the turn of the 20th
			century, natural oyster habitats had been greatly diminished thanks to overharvesting,
			pollution, and disease, and they have since continued to deplete. The native oyster population
			has dropped to a shocking 1% of its historical levels over the past decades in Maryland.</p> <p>But losing oysters translates to more than just the rising prices of a delicacy on the dinner
			table. It also signifies a loss of a natural filter that is critical to the health of our
			seawater. According to Marine conservationists, each adult oyster can filter up to 50 gallons
			of water a day, and an oyster bed can reduce the force of waves on wetlands, which protects
			coastlines from erosion.</p> <p>To counteract this decline, Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) began building
			sanctuaries and seeding Chesapeake Bay with young oysters. Thanks to their efforts, the
			oysters are making a comeback.</p> <h2>Pushed Hard</h2> <p>MDNR has made two key efforts, one of which was expanding the restoration sanctuaries in 2010.</p> <p>Sanctuaries permanently close oyster beds to harvesting except in specific aquaculture lease
			sites, allowing oysters to grow undisturbed. The goal of this preservation is to build a
			strong breeding population of oysters that will build the reefs which provide crucial habitats
			for other bay species.</p></div> <div class="content-container svelte-1ca93iu"><div class="chart-container svelte-1ca93iu"><!--[!--><!--]--><!----></div> <div class="scrolly-container svelte-1ca93iu"><div><!----><!--[--><div class="step svelte-1ca93iu active"><div class="step-content svelte-1ca93iu"><p>In Maryland, the estimated population of native eastern oysters hit a historic low in 2004, dropping to just 19 tons.
