This is a personal project based on my interests. In March 2024, I attended the NICAR conference in Baltimore, where I had oysters twice over three days. This inspired me to explore data on the relationship between Maryland oysters and climate change.

Another personal goal is to try out my graphic skills, dig into climate change stories, and practice pitching and writing for local audiences.

This app is built on the <a href=
